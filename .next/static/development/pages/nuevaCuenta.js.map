A standard or normal presentation of a mathematical entity [or\n//    object]. A canonical form is an element of a set of representatives\n//    of equivalence classes of forms such that there is a function or\n//    procedure which projects every element of each equivalence class\n//    onto that one element, the canonical form of that equivalence\n//    class. The canonical form is expected to be simpler than the rest of\n//    the forms in some way.\n//\n// That's a long-winded way of saying any two objects that have the same\n// canonical form may be considered equivalent, even if they are !==,\n// which usually means the objects are structurally equivalent (deeply\n// equal), but don't necessarily use the same memory.\n//\n// Like a literary or musical canon, this ObjectCanon class represents a\n// collection of unique canonical items (JavaScript objects), with the\n// important property that canon.admit(a) === canon.admit(b) if a and b\n// are deeply equal to each other. In terms of the definition above, the\n// canon.admit method is the \"function or procedure which projects every\"\n// object \"onto that one element, the canonical form.\"\n//\n// In the worst case, the canonicalization process may involve looking at\n// every property in the provided object tree, so it takes the same order\n// of time as deep equality checking. Fortunately, already-canonicalized\n// objects are returned immediately from canon.admit, so the presence of\n// canonical subtrees tends to speed up canonicalization.\n//\n// Since consumers of canonical objects can check for deep equality in\n// constant time, canonicalizing cache results can massively improve the\n// performance of application code that skips re-rendering unchanged\n// results, such as \"pure\" UI components in a framework like React.\n//\n// Of course, since canonical objects may be shared widely between\n// unrelated consumers, it's important to think of them as immutable, even\n// though they are not actually frozen with Object.freeze in production,\n// due to the extra performance overhead that comes with frozen objects.\n//\n// Custom scalar objects whose internal class name is neither Array nor\n// Object can be included safely in the admitted tree, but they will not\n// be replaced with a canonical version (to put it another way, they are\n// assumed to be canonical already).\n//\n// If we ignore custom objects, no detection of cycles or repeated object\n// references is currently required by the StoreReader class, since\n// GraphQL result objects are JSON-serializable trees (and thus contain\n// neither cycles nor repeated subtrees), so we can avoid the complexity\n// of keeping track of objects we've already seen during the recursion of\n// the admit method.\n//\n// In the future, we may consider adding additional cases to the switch\n// statement to handle other common object types, such as \"[object Date]\"\n// objects, as needed.\nvar ObjectCanon = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function ObjectCanon() {\n        // Set of all canonical objects this ObjectCanon has admitted, allowing\n        // canon.admit to return previously-canonicalized objects immediately.\n        this.known = new (canUseWeakSet ?

A schema definition is then supplied to the\n * validator and executor.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const MyAppSchema = new GraphQLSchema({\n *   query: MyAppQueryRootType,\n *   mutation: MyAppMutationRootType,\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Note: When the schema is constructed, by default only the types that are\n * reachable by traversing the root types are included, other types must be\n * explicitly referenced.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const characterInterface = new GraphQLInterfaceType({\n *   name: 'Character',\n *   ...\n * });\n *\n * const humanType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n *   name: 'Human',\n *   interfaces: [characterInterface],\n *   ...\n * });\n *\n * const droidType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n *   name: 'Droid',\n *   interfaces: [characterInterface],\n *   ...\n * });\n *\n * const schema = new GraphQLSchema({\n *   query: new GraphQLObjectType({\n *     name: 'Query',\n *     fields: {\n *       hero: { type: characterInterface, ... },\n *     }\n *   }),\n *   ...\n *   // Since this schema references only the `Character` interface it's\n *   // necessary to explicitly list the types that implement it if\n *   // you want them to be included in the final schema.\n *   types: [humanType, droidType],\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Note: If an array of `directives` are provided to GraphQLSchema, that will be\n * the exact list of directives represented and allowed. If `directives` is not\n * provided then a default set of the specified directives (e.g. `@include` and\n * `@skip`) will be used. If you wish to provide *additional* directives to these\n * specified directives, you must explicitly declare them. Example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const MyAppSchema = new GraphQLSchema({\n *   ...\n *   directives: specifiedDirectives.concat([ myCustomDirective ]),\n * })\n * ```\n */\nexport class GraphQLSchema {\n  // Used as a cache for validateSchema().\n  constructor(config) {\n    var _config$extensionASTN, _config$directives;\n\n    // If this schema was built from a source known to be valid, then it may be\n    // marked with assumeValid to avoid an additional type system validation.\n    this.__validationErrors = config.assumeValid === true ?
